     * Note: ADAL JS does not validate the token received from Azure AD. It relies on the app’s 
     * backend to do so, and until we call the backend, we don’t know if the user obtained an 
     * acceptable token. Business applications should have a server-side component for user 
     * authentication built into the web application for security reasons. Without this backend token 
     * validation, your app is susceptible to security attacks such as the confused deputy problem.
